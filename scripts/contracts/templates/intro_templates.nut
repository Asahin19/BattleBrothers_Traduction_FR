Vous êtes sur le point de tirer votre épée lorsqu\'il vous explique rapidement qu\'un homme du nom de %employeur% cherche à faire votre connaissance. En rengainant votre arme, vous dites à l\'étranger de vous conduire à lui - s\'il a des affaires, il devrait vous le dire lui-même. Le messager hoche la tête et ouvre la voie vers la maison d\'un noble. | Un messager - un jeune garçon à peu près aussi grand qu\'une épée longue - sprinte près de vous, lançant un parchemin en l\'air alors qu\'il passe devant vous. Vous l\'attrapez, mais au moment où vous pouvez chercher l\'enfant, il est déjà parti. En haussant les épaules, vous ouvrez le parchemin et trouvez le nom de %employer%. Il semble avoir besoin de vos services. Le trajet vers la maison d\'un noble est indiqué au bas du parchemin. | En vous promenant dans %townname%, un messager s\'installe à côté de vous. Vous avez à peine le temps de le regarder que le pauvre type vous jette un parchemin dans les mains avant de s\'enfuir. Vous vous ouvrez pour voir qu\'un noble local a demandé votre audience. | %townname% semble assez paisible, mais quelque chose ne va pas car un messager vient vous voir avec un avis d\'un noble local. Et là où il y a des richesses, il y a des ennuis... | Un messager vous accueille. Il se nomme comme quelqu\'un d\'oubliable, parce que vous oubliez instantanément son nom. Cependant, ses informations sont assez importantes : un noble local a demandé votre audience. | Un oiseau vole jusqu\'à votre épaule et s\'y plante. Il roucoule vers vous, puis fait un geste vers ses pieds où un avis a été enroulé. A la seconde où vous prenez le message, l\'oiseau est parti, sans demander son reste. La lecture de la note révèle qu\'un noble local, et ami présumé des créatures de la volière, a demandé votre audience. | Un chien en laisse court vers vous avec beaucoup d\'aboiements. L\'homme au bout de la laisse fait un signe de tête vers le chien. Vous voyez un parchemin accroché à son collier, la bête une sorte de bâtard portant un message. Ça ou quelqu\'un rigole un peu.\n\n En prenant le parchemin, vous lisez qu\'un noble local a demandé vos services. Ce n\'est peut-être pas une blague après tout. Le chien aboie simplement à nouveau et remue la queue, assis consciencieusement et ayant l\'air plutôt satisfait. | Un homme au dos droit marche vers vous. Il a un parchemin dans un bras levé, s\'approchant de vous comme un babillard sur pilotis. Il ne dit rien, étend simplement son bras et vous prenez simplement le message comme on vous le demande. Il lit qu\'un noble local vous recherche et probablement vos services. Vous remerciez le messager, mais il ne dit rien, se contentant de se retourner et de marcher sur la route. | En descendant la route de %townname%\, quelques hommes crient depuis une taverne locale, hurlant de rire en vous faisant signe. En ricanant et en se pliant en deux, ils peuvent à peine recracher leurs nouvelles : apparemment, un noble recherche un mercenaire. Intéressant, mais vous ne pouvez pas vous empêcher de demander pourquoi ils riaient. Les hommes se taisent un instant et l\'un hausse les épaules tandis qu\'un autre crache une réponse.%SPEECH_ON%Parce que nous sommes saouls ?%SPEECH_OFF%Les hommes gardent un air impassible une seconde de plus avant d\'éclater de rire une fois de plus. | Un serviteur d\'un noble local vous demande de le suivre sur ordre de son maître. Il vous conduit dans la partie la plus riche de %townname%, où les bâtiments deviennent plus hauts et les rues piétonnes ne puent pas le fumier de cheval. Finalement, vous atteignez un manoir qui ressemble à un temple. De faux hiboux parsèment les combles, vous fixant pendant que vous passez. Un chat à l\'air déprimé tourne au ralenti sur le perron. Vous entrez par une porte d\'entrée qui rugit d\'opulence, ses charnières et son large balancement résonnant dans le hall. Votre bouche reste ouverte car vous connaissez à peine les mots pour décrire la grandeur à l\'intérieur.}",
